<h3>Dr. Seuss’ How The Grinch Stole Christmas</h3>
<p>The Grinch who stole Christmas has a reason for growing up to be so bitter. <br />
   As a child, he was picked on for being green and having hair all over his body and a beard. <br/>
   Show me the child who would not pick on such a classmate and I will show you Baby Jesus. But if “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas” had only worked on that angle some more, had drummed up a little more sympathy for the Grinch, maybe we wouldn’t want to pick on him too.</p>

<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>The pre-release buzz is true: This is not your father’s financial crisis movie. Nor, for that matter, is it “The Wolf of Wall Street.” The money masters of the universe depicted in this film—and while their stories are interconnected, their lives are not, necessarily—barely drink a sufficient amount of red wine to get a good buzz on. Their buzz derives from an enhanced sense of smell. The closest to a “Wolf”-like character here is Ryan Gosling’s Jared Vennett, the most standard-issue suit-and-tie banking bro of the bunch, and part of his schtick is to stand in a conference room sniffing ostentatiously because, yes, he smells money.</p>

<h3>Legend</h3>
<p>The Kray Brothers, Reggie and Ronnie, were such ostentatiously violent and vulgar gangsters that they practically constituted a self-parody. They were both newly in jail when the then-also-new comedy troupe Monty Python’s Flying Circus deemed to lampoon them with a sketch about “The Piranha Brothers,” Doug and Dinsdale, but the thing about that sketch, as it happened, was just how little it needed to stray from reality in order to hit the comic mark. Nevertheless, the Krays, who ruled criminal London from the late 1950s until their imprisonment in 1968, did real and wide-ranging human harm in their careers; this is a fact that Brian Helgeland, writer and director of a new crime movie about the twins, doesn’t seem to have any good ideas about what to do with. But that isn’t why “Legend” is such a muddle right off the bat.</p>
